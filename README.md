# lotw-android
a leaf on the wind, android version.

I'm opening the source to this, though you'll need the assets to run it. They aren't terribly complex. Mostly some circles.

Built with the excellent libgdx -- tested on android and iOS.

If you just want to play, http://anism.org/lotw/ hosts an old version. If you'd like to purchase the new and vastly improved game for android, go [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.anism.lotwp.android).
